        <h1> My Hobbies </h1>
        <h2> I am Umaiza Waseem and i am in Grade 7. </h2>
        <h3> Today i am going to tell you guys about my hobbies. </h3>
        <p> My hobbies are to explore computer softwares and to read new books. I think that exploring computer software and reading books are two hobbies that combine creativity and knowledge. Delving into
        software allows you to discover new tools, enhance your technical skills, and stay updated with the latest innovations.
        On the other hand, reading books opens up a world of imagination, learning, and deep thinking. Together, these hobbies
        provide a perfect balance between technology and intellectual growth.</p>
        <h4> This was all about my hobbies. </h4>
